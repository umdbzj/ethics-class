 <h1>Most Basic Page Ever</h1>
  <p>HTML - Hyper-Text Markup Language -
defines sections and structure of a document by using (generally) paired tags
denoted by "<>" signs.  The tag that begins a region is just a pair of angle
brackets; the closing tag of the pair includes a "/" such as
&quot;&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;. You can look at the HTML of any page by viewing the
source file.  How to reveal the background document varies depending upon the
browser you use. </p> 
<p>There are many special symbols, as you may notice.
These begin with &quot;&amp;&quot; and end with a &quot;;&quot; --- you get used
to them. </p> 
<p>Contrary to popular perception, HTML is not meant to define the
appearance of a page. That feature is handled by the &quot;styling&quot; of tags
with formatting instructions. Styling can be done within a tag, in a section in
the head of the HTML page, or in a separate file (called a &quot;style
sheet&quot;). If more than one style rule is applied to an HTML tag (aka
&quot;element&quot;), then the nearest one in the hierarchy of tag, page,
stylesheet. Hence the &quot;cascading&quot; in cascading style sheets (or CSS,
as it is known).</p> 
<p>One trademark of HTML is the ability to link to other
pages via hyperlinks. You may want to bookmark the <a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3C School Tutorial Page</a>. The W3C is
the standards consortium for HTML and related technologies. </p> 

<p>Even people
who know HTML often use WYSIWYG editors that do most of the routine section
definitions and codes, tweaking it as needed and adding styling. I usually use
Dreamweaver, although it has gotten expensive. You can use any text editing
program that doesn't add special characters: TextWrangler, vi, emacs, TextEdit,
etc. </p>
