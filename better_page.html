<h1>Better Page</h1>
<p>This page is starting to use styling to control the appearance of the various elements 
on the page. A style sheet, named &quot;<a href="basic_style.css">basic style.css</a>&quot; 
has been linked to the page and is changing the font of all of the elements on the page 
to &quot;Verdana&quot;, which is a font designed to be easy to read on electronic devices.  
The h1, h2, and h3 headers are in a serif style called &quot;Cambria&quot; to set them off f
rom the body text. </p>
<p>There are so many options that you can play around with. 
See the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">W3C School's CSS Tutorial</a> 
for ideas and play around. </p>
