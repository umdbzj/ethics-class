	<h1>Examples for Ethics Class</h1>
	<p>This page is a very early work-in-progress, but it will soon have examples of HTML pages
	in progression from bare-bones to accessibly styled examples.</p>
	<p>It will also soon have examples of JavaScript code that you <b>may</b> use as a starting point if
	you give credit to Barbara Z. Johnson or Melissa Lynn (depending upon the segment).</p>
	
	<h2>Basic HTML and Simple CSS</h2>
	<p>Start with the <a href="basic_page.html">most basic page ever</a> to get started with the structure of an HTML page
	and essential tags.</p>
	<p>Then, you can take a look at how the page evolves with some simple styling in a CSS document
	that is linked to the HTML page.  The text's font and headings change to suggested web
	fonts.  A sans-serif font should be used for the majority of the text.  Verdana is a font
	designed to be easily readable in digital form.  You might also consider using a font designed
	to be more readable for people who have dyslexia, such as OpenDys.  For headings, it is
	often recommended that you use a serif font, such as Cambria or Times New Roman. 
	You can see the <a href="better_page.html">example page</a> and also look at the 
	<a href="basic_style.css">separate style sheet</a> for examples.</p>
	<p>Playing around with website appearances is a lot of fun.  Feel free to experiment for
	now.  I created this <a href="styling.html">styled web page</a> as an example of how the <em>order</em> of CSS styling 
	impacts the final results. Depending upon which body style is "closest" to the body tag, 
	this page can be a bit hard on the eyes ... </p>
	<p>There are some very <a href="usefultags.html">useful tags</a>, which can create tables and lists in web pages. 
	Practicing with these two would be next on my recommended skills progression.</p>
	
	<h2>Getting Started with JavaScript</h2>
	<p>There is so much that you can do with JavaScript!  I have <a href="dynamicexample.html">
	an example page</a> with some initial ideas to get you warmed up:  
	<ul>
	<li>a button that changes some text when clicked</li>
	<li>an image map that triggers an alert</li>
	<li>drawing a simple shape</li>
	<li>an image that changes on a cycle</li>
	<li>an image that responds to user clicks</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>More JavaScript</h2>
	<p>This <a href="arrayexample.html">random quotes page </a>will generate a random quote each time the page is loaded or
	refreshed.  It is an example of common programming operations that you probably know
	from Python or C++ ... just a different syntax!</p>
	
	<p>Charts can be a great way to use JavaScript to show data to your readers.  The <a 
	href="chart.html">change
	in % of CS professionals by cohort</a> document is an example that uses the ChartJS library to
	create a graph with minimal effort.</p>
	
	<p>This <a href="canvas.html">scatterplot of random y-axis data</a> was made with a basic canvas and JavaScript.</p>
	
	<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
	<p>In computer science and software development, we all stand on the shoulders of giants
	who have gone before or have traveled with us, to paraphrase Sir Isaac Newton.  
	The examples in this website were created or inspired by many people.  Where possible,
	I have identified content creators for specific program sections.  Additionally, I want to 
	thank colleagues who worked with me on Software Design and Development at Grinnell College:
