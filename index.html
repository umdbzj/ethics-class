	<p>This page is a very early work-in-progress, but it will soon have examples of HTML pages
	in progression from bare-bones to accessibly styled examples.</p>
	<p>It will also soon have examples of JavaScript code that you <b>may</b> use as a starting point if
	you give credit to Barbara Z. Johnson or Melissa Lynn (depending upon the segment).)
