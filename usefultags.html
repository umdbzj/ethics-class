<h1>Some Really Useful Tags</h1>
<p>These constructions take more than one tag and are often used in creative ways to control regions of a page. Lists, for instance, can be turned into accessible navigation bars that adjust fairly well to different screen sizes without resorting to the use of frameworks (such as Bootstrap). </p>
<p>Tables are often abused as a way to control where sections of a page will appear. They should be used to display tabular data only, leaving positioning in the hands of CSS.</p>
<h2>Lists - Ordered and Unordered</h2>
<p>Lists by themselves are useful to display .... well ..... lists such as:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Thing One</li>
  <li>Thing Two</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>A thought</li>
	<li>Another thought</li>
	<li>Cloud watching time</li>
	<li>Or is it meditation?</li>
</ul>


<p>Ordered lists are defined between  the &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;/ol&gt; tags; unordered lists are between &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;/ul&gt; tags. And each item in the list appear between &lt;li&gt; and &lt;/li&gt; tags. Lists can be nested, and their appearance can be changed through use of styles. This ability to change the appearance forms the basis of a useful navigation bar.</p>
<h2>Tables</h2>
<p>A table begins with the &lt;table width="??%&gt; tag (and ends with &lt;/table&gt;).  Each row is defined by &lt;tr&gt; ... &lt;/tr&gt; sets. And within each row, the &lt;td&gt; and &lt;/td&gt; tags define the individual cells. &lt;th&gt; ... &lt;/th&gt; can be used to create column headings.  Row headings can also be defined by using &lt;th scope="row"&gt; ...&lt;/th&gt;. </p>
<table width="50%" border="1">
