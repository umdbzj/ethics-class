<h1>JavaScript Programming Assignment Examples</h1>
<h2>Hello, World!</h2>
<p>The first program nearly everyone writes is not quite enough unless you go through extra
work to make it fit the requirements.</p>
<button onclick="displayMessage()">Click me!  
</button>
<p id="first"> </p>

<h2>Guess My Number</h2>
<p>Another classic early program is this one: the computer has selected a number between 
1 and 100, inclusive.  Try to guess the number in 10 or fewer tries.</p>
<p> Click the 'Play the Game' button to start.</p>

<div class="debug">
<!--	<p id="rn">The target number is ....</p> -->
	<p id="turn">Guess number: 0 </p>
	<p id="guess"> </p>
</div>

<div class="game">
<button onclick="playGMN()">Play the Game</button>

<!-- Get player guess -->
<p>
	<label for="guessField">Enter a guess:</label>
	<input type="number" id="guessField" class="guessField" />
	<!-- input type="submit" value="Submit guess" class="guessSubmit" / -->


<!-- Check guess -->
<button id="subbutton" onclick="checkGuess()">Submit guess</button></p>
<p id = "feedback">   </p>

<button onclick="resetGame()">Reset</button>
</div>


<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>For this page, I took inspiration from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash">
A First Splash into JavaScript</a> by mozilla.org, although
I did quite a few things in a different (less elegant) fashion.  The guessing game has room
for a lot of improvements!!  If you decide to take this as your starting point, I will expect 
that you clean up some of the rough spots and make it look more attractive, without copying
from an online example.</p>
