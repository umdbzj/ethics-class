<h1>Example of Styling with CSS</h1> 
<p>This page is styled using all three of the levels of CSS styling. The Introduction heading
is styled to be blue within the element tag itself.  The font of heading levels 1 through
3 are styled via a rule placed in the head tag of the page.  And the body font is styled
through a rule in an external style sheet.</p>

<!-- Example of styling in the element -->
<h2 style="color:blue">Introduction</h2>
<p> These are the voyages of the
Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds, to
seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone
before. We need to neutralize the homing signal. Each unit has total
environmental control, gravity, temperature, atmosphere, light, in a protective
field. Sensors show energy readings in your area. We had a forced chamber
explosion in the resonator coil. Field strength has increased by 3,000 percent.
</p>

<h2>Astrobabble</h2>
<p> We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... Is a remarkable
piece of bio-electronic engineering by which I see much of the EM spectrum
ranging from heat and infrared through radio waves, et cetera, and forgive me if
I've said and listened to this a thousand times. This planet's interior heat
provides an abundance of geothermal energy. We need to neutralize the homing
signal. </p>

<h2>Take Action!</h2>
<p> Run a manual sweep of anomalous airborne or electromagnetic readings.
Radiation levels in our atmosphere have increased by 3,000 percent.
Electromagnetic and subspace wave fronts approaching synchronization. What is
the strength of the ship's deflector shields at maximum output? The wormhole's
size and short period would make this a local phenomenon. Do you have sufficient
data to compile a holographic simulation? </p>

<h2 style="color: green">Notable Vessels</h2>
<ul>
<li>
USS Hathaway - NCC-2593 - Decommissioned, participated in exercises against the USS Enterprise-D. 
Its destruction was faked in a ruse to foil Ferengi attackers.
</li>
<li>
USS Shenandoah - NCC-73024 - Taken by Dax and Worf to rescue a Cardassian informant from 
the Dominion. Severely damaged by the Jem'Hadar en route to deliver diplomatic message to Grand Nagus Zek.
</li>
<li>
Shuttlecraft Cochrane - USS Voyager Test bed for Warp 10 flight piloted by Tom Paris. Very 
closely resembles the later hull design for Delta Flyer. Destroyed attempting to retrieve Warp Core.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Borg</h2>
<p> Resistance is futile. </p>
